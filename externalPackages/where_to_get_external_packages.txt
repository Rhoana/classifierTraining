I wrote the code just using the following external packages.

The most important dependency and the one you most probably won't be able to get rid of is the random forest wrapper and implementation:

http://code.google.com/p/randomforest-matlab/

When I started with this project, the normxcorr2 function of Matlab was quite slow and I was happy to find this library normxcorr2_mex wrapper around openCVs cross correlation. You can either change the code to use the matlab internal version or get the normxcorr2_mex package from here:

http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~deaton/remarks_ncc.html

Another very stupid dependency is the SIFT package. I just happen to like the included imsmooth function a lot. I know there is Gaussian blurr as a mtlab filter, so again, feel free to either change the code to get rid of the dependency or get the sift package from here:

http://www.vlfeat.org/~vedaldi/code/sift.html
